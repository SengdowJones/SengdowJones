<h3>ðŸŒ± Sengdao Inthavong (he/him/his) | Data Engineer Intern @ Optum</h3>
<b>I like to design creative solutions!</b> Ever since I founded a data-driven chess league that brought hundreds of high school players together, I knew that I could make a positive impact on the communities that I am a part of by leveraging the technology I had to provide a platform. As a first-generation Laotian-American student, I have learned how important it is for people to come together to support one another. <br></br> Currently, I am a rising junior pursuing my BS/MS in Computer Science from Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering with an emphasis on Software Development and Interfaces with expected graduation in June 2024. I work as an Undergraduate Research Assistant for tiilt Lab, a research lab that aims to improve learning opportunities for students from under-served communities. I apply my passions for innovation, data, and human-computer interaction during my time in the lab and the classroom. <br></br> This summer, I will be interning as a <b>Data Engineer at Optum</b>, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group. I am looking forward to working at a 2022 Fortune 500 company where I can further develop my data analytics skills and learn from senior engineers. After I graduate, my dream is to be a data scientist or software engineer at a company where I can leave a positive, lasting mark on people's lives.
